# Alternative user PMs button for Admin

A Discourse theme component that helps admins from accidentally access users' direct messages.

This is done by moving the <kbd>✉️ Messages</kbd> tab from the user profile page to the user admin page, as a <kbd>✉️ Show Messages</kbd> button.

Besides preventing accidental access to users' messages, it moves the feature in a proper admin context.
