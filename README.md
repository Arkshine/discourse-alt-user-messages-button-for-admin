# Alternative user PMs button for Admin

A small Discourse theme component for Admins that moves the  <kbd>✉️ Messages</kbd> button from public users' profiles to the user admin page as a <kbd>✉️ Show Messages</kbd> button, keeping the intent in a proper admin context.

Besides preventing accidental access to users' messages, it moves the feature in a proper admin context.
