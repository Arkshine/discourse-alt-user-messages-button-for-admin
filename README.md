# Alternative user's messages button for admin

A Discourse theme component that helps the admin reduces accidental access to a user's direct messages from its profile.

The issue has been talked about here https://meta.discourse.org/t/add-a-warning-when-checking-direct-messages-from-a-user-public-profile-as-an-admin/215630.

This component mitigates this by doing two things:
* Remove the "Messages" tab in a user's profile
* Add a button "Show messages" in the admin panel.
_Clicking on it redirects to the user's profile without the "Messages" tab._

That way, this makes the context of admin action relevant and less prone to errors.
Users' perceptions and trust levels are kept safe.
